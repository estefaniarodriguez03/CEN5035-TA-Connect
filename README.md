# CEN5035 Group Project: TA Connect

## Project Name 
**TA Connect**

## Project Description
TA Connect is a web platform that streamlines the office hours experience of university teaching assistants (TAs) and their students. The application provides a real time virtual queue, estimated wait times, and push notifications to reduce idle time for students. TAs can view, reorder, and launch office hour sessions while students can queue, and view TA schedules once logged in. TA Connect essentially offers an efficient office hours scheduling system that solves frequent problems with current scheduling methods.
